# Resources

## Recommended on-line resources about Stoicism

There are many articles, blog posts, lecture viduos, and podcasts on
Stocism. Some of them are excellent, but many others are highly
inaccurate. Some of the best (accurate) resources are:

 * ["Stoicisms Ancient and Modern"](https://modernstoicism.com/stoicisms-ancient-and-modern-by-tony-a-a-long/) by A. A. Long (available as [a lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xuQ4i46K_M))
 * ["What is Stoicism"](https://modernstoicism.com/what-is-stoicism-by-john-sellars/) by John Sellars is a brief, simple overview of Stoic philosophy (also available as [a lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nz5nDXgLZw))
 * The [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/) has many good entries related to Stoicism. Of particular interest are those on [Stoicism](https://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/), [Stoic philosophy of mind](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicmind/), [Stoic ethics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/), [Epictetus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epictetu/), [Marcus Aurelius](http://www.iep.utm.edu/marcus/), [Cicero](http://www.iep.utm.edu/cicero/), and [Chrysippus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/).
 * The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/) has a more technical [entry on Stoicism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/), giving more weight to Stoic physics, logic, and technical aspects of the Stoic psychology than most modern accounts. 
 * Wikipedia has several articles covering topics related to Stoicism. Helpful entries include the ones on [Stoicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism), [eudaimonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) (particularly the section on [eudaimonia in Stoicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia#The_Stoics)), [arete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete), and [natural law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law) (particularly the section on [Stoic natural law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#Stoic_natural_law)).
 * [Donald Robertson's blog](http://philosophy-of-cbt.com/stoic-philosophy-blog-archives/) has several useful introductory posts, including [The System of Stoic Philosophy](http://philosophy-of-cbt.com/2012/10/18/the-system-of-stoic-philosophy/), [A Simplified Modern Approach to Stoicism](http://philosophy-of-cbt.com/2013/02/03/a-simplified-modern-approach-to-stoicism/), and [An Introduction to Stoic Practice: The Three Disciplines of Stoicism](http://philosophy-of-cbt.com/2013/02/20/introduction-to-stoicism-the-three-disciplines/).
 * [The Stoic Philosophy](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/murray_lecture) is a transcript of a 1915 lecture by [Gilbert Murray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Murray). Although it reflects the attitudes and prejudices of the culture and times in which it was delivered as well, it still provides a reasonable introduction to the philosophy.
 * [Captains of the Soul](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol64/iss1/4/) by Michael Evans is a short overview specifically tailored for members of the military.



## Recommended books for newcomers to Stoicism

There is no "one best" work for a modern person to study to learn about Stoicism. Instead, there are a variety of resources, the suitability of which depends on exactly what the reader is looking for. The following list includes common choices, and ones regular posters on /r/Stoicism have found particularly useful.

**The [*Discourses* and *Enchiridion* of Epictetus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchiridion_of_Epictetus)**

There were originally twelve formal lectures by Epictetus, plus eight books of informal discussions (*Discourses*) and a handbook of short reminders (the "Enchiridion") recorded by his student, Arrian. Of these, all of the lectures and four of the books of discourses are lost: what remains available are four of the books of discourses and the handbook.

The *Enchiridion* is a very short book of aphorisms, reminder, and exhortations derived from Epictetus's other works, intended as reminders for students of Stoic philosophy. Their  inspirational character and brevity makes them an attractive and approachable introduction to Stoicism, while at the same time the lack of explanation and context can lead to significant misinterpretation: many of the enduring and common misunderstandings of Stoicism arise from reading the *Enchiridion* without sufficient context.

The *Discourses* themselves provide much of that context and explanation, particularly when it concerns practical application. Even the *Discourses*, though, are not formal, complete, or systematic presentations of Stoic philosophy, and it assumes a significant knowledge of the works of earlier philosophers that would have been studied in the formal lessons, and perhaps the (now lost) formal lectures by Epictetus himself. Sometimes these references are direct and obvious (e.g. explicit mentions of a dialogue by Plato), but often the references are transparent to readers of English translations (e.g. brief references to arguments presented at length in other works, or usage of technical Greek terms only used in Stoic theory, but translated as common English words). 

Despite these limitations, and perhaps because they do not digress into theoretical discussions, the *Discourses* can provide a practical, inspirational introduction to Stoic thought.  Students studying Stoicism should be prepared, however, to revise their interpretation as they read additional sources.

Many translations of the *Discourses* and *Enchiridion* are available, and several are public domain and online; among the best free translations is [that of Oldfather](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Epictetus,_the_Discourses_as_reported_by_Arrian,_the_Manual,_and_Fragments). [Anthony A. Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._Long), who should not be confused with George Long (who made a much older translation), translated the *Enchiridion* and included a selection from the *Discourses* under the title [*How to be Free*](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/13246.html). *How to be Free* is a particularly clear translation for new, modern readers and includes an excellent introduction that helps prevent misinterpretation.

**The *Meditations* of Marcus Aurelius**

In addition to reading and memorizing exhortations and reminders of the type compiled in the *Enchiridion*, Stoic practice sometimes included writing exercises. The *Meditations* of Marcus Aurelius are thought to the a compilation of such exercises. 

The strengths and weaknesses in studying Stoicism through the *Meditations* are similar to those of studying the *Enchiridion*: the entries are short, approachable, and easily browsed, and also (in good translations) often beautiful and inspiring. At the same time, they were composed for the author himself, not an external audience, so much is lost in context, and significant background information is assumed.

In spite of these similarities, the *Meditations* and the *Enchiridion* can be very different works; Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus each had their own personalities and idiosyncrasies, and these show in their works.

Modern readers are encouraged to read the [IEP entry on Marcus Aurelius](http://www.iep.utm.edu/marcus/) to help interpret his book.

There are many translations of the *Meditations*. See [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_the_best_translation_of_marcus_aurelius.27s_meditations.3F) for more discussion of those available, and links to free online versions.

**The Letters and Essays of Seneca the Younger, and the Essays of Cicero**

In both Greece and Rome, philosophers wrote primarily in Greek. Not only were Epictetus's *Enchiridion* and *Dialogues* were written in Greek, but also Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations* and the preponderance of other (mostly lost, now) books of philosophy. Seneca and Cicero, however, wrote in Latin, and appear to have had a wider, more "popular" audience in mind. Their essays and letters present more systematic and exhaustive discussions of their topics, and are less cryptic and open to misinterpretation. Because they were in Latin rather than Greek, they were more influential for significant periods in European history during which literacy in Latin was more common than literacy in Greek.

Seneca the Younger was a wealthy Roman polician who wrote a number of essays and letters on Stoicism.  Particularly good starting points for beginners written by Seneca include:

* "[De Tranquillitate](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Peace_of_Mind)" (Of Peace of Mind)
* "[De Vita Beata](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_a_Happy_Life)" (Of a Happy Life)
* "[De Brevitate Vitae](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life)" (On the Shortness of Life)
* [*Epistulae Morales*](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius) (Letters to Lucilius), a collection of 124 short (a few pages each) letters. 

One good translation of these essays (and several others) is [*Seneca: Dialogues and Essays*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dialogues-and-essays-9780199552405), translated by John Davies.  [*Seneca: Selected Letters*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/selected-letters-9780199533213), translated by Elaine Fantham, is a good source for the *Epistulae Morales*, but includes only 80 out of the full 124. (The link above provides the full set, in an older translation.)

Cicero was another, earlier Roman politician. He studied with philosophers from several schools, including the Epicureans, Stoics, and Academics (Platonists), and although he regarded himself as an Academic, he was sympathetic to Stoic philosophy as well. He wrote most of his philosophical works between 44 and 46 BC. Works written at these times were not (and were not purported to be) original works, but were rather Latin paraphrases of books (written in Greek) by philosophers from a variety of schools, supplemented with Cicero's own examples, and sometimes combined with works on the same topic from philosophers of other schools into imagined debates between different philosophies. 

Works particularly recommended for newcomers to Stoicism include:

* [*De Officiis*](http://www.stoics.com/cicero_book.html) (On Duties), based on a book by the Stoic philosopher [Panaetius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panaetius). Cicero formats it as a letter of advice to his son. It offers some of the most concrete examples of using Stoic philosophy, and although the circumstance of the audience is far removed from that of modern readers, is interesting as an example of application.
* [*De Finibus*](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Finibus/home.html) (On Ends), a compilation of paraphrases of several works by philosophers of different schools, ostensibly in answer to the question of identifying the "ultimate aim, which gives the standard for all principles of well-being and right conduct." Book 3 gives the Stoic account, and is the clearest surviving systematic presentation of the theory behind Stoic ethics. In contrast with *On Duties*, *On Ends* is the most theoretical of the ancient Stoic works recommended for beginners. The identity of the specific philosopher Cicero is paraphrasing in book 3 is unknown; in his introduction to the Loeb edition, [Harris Rackham](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Times/1944/Obituary/Harris_Rackham) speculates that it was [Diogenes of Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_of_Babylon), the fifth head of the Stoic school. 

**The Guided Tour: [*Stoic Serenity: A Practical Guide to Finding Inner Peace*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1847538177) by Keith Seddon**

Keith Seddon's book is not a "stand-alone" introduction to Stoicism. It is intended to be read in conjunction with Robin Campbell's translation of Seneca in *Seneca: Letters from a Stoic* and Robin Hard's translation of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations*, and provides extensive discussion and quotes from other Stoic authors such as Epictetus to help the reader interpret and understand the philosophy as a cohesive system.


**Short, Accessible Introductions**

These short introductions present concise overviews of historical Stoicism, and make excellent introductions or supplementary reading for those learning primarily from the primary sources above:

* [*Stoicism: A Very Short Introduction*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0198786662) (135 pages) by Brad Inwood
* [*Lessons in Stoicism*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0241382777) (96 pages) by John Sellars (also published under the title [*The Pocket Stoic*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=022668296X))

**Modern Adaptations**

Historical writing and descriptions are often difficult to put into practice, and modern people inspired by Stoicism are typically selective about what aspects of historical Stoicism they embrace, modify what they do embrace, and supplement Stoic philosophy with other influences. 

* [*Stoicism and the Art of Happiness*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1444187104) and [*How to Think Like a Roman Emperor*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1250196620) by Donald Robertson are both practical, readable introductions to Stoicism intended for modern practice, readable independent of historical sources, combing selected elements of Stoic theory with exercises inspired by Stoicism and supplemented by techniques and developments from modern psychiatric therapies. *Art of Happiness* presents theory and exercises in the style of modern "self-help" book, while *Emperor* is structured around a biography of Marcus Aurelius, in which Stoic theory and exercises are presented as digressions. The content of the two overlap significantly, although the first places more emphasis on the theory, and the second, history. 
* [*A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0195374614) by William Irvine is controversial among readers of /r/Stoicism. It is one of the most clear, easy to read, and practical accounts of Stoicism available, but critics feel it waters down and distorts many central elements of the philosophy. Additional discussion of Irvine's book can be found [here](http://philosophy-of-cbt.com/2013/05/17/review-of-irvines-a-guide-to-the-good-life-the-ancient-art-of-stoic-joy-2009/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1b6akp/i_thought_william_irvines_book_on_stoicism_was/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/rkzyd/william_irvine_criticism_and_appreciation_post/).

**Collections of Excerpts and Quotes**

Collections of excerpts and quotes are a popular way to become familiar with Stoicism, and several such collections are available. Some popular examples are:

* [*The Practicing Stoic*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1567926118) by Ward Farnsworth
* [*The Daily Stoic*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0735211736) by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman
* [*The Reign of the Stoics*](https://archive.org/details/reignstoics00unkngoog/page/n12) by Frederic May Holland (free online, or commercially as a [facsimile reprint](https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/books/TheReignoftheStoics_10033347))

All of these include explanations and commentary.

**Historical Stoicism**

The emphasis in the accounts listed in the previous section are strongly influenced by the intent to provide a basis for modern practice. Several aspects of historical Stoicism are both challenging for modern readers to understand and unlikely to be adopted even if understood, and so are discussed only very briefly in the sources intended for modern practice. However, these elements, including Stoic cosmology, theology, and physics, were fundamentally important to many of the Stoics themselves, and understanding them is essential to understanding their place in the history of science and philosophy. Those interested in Stoicism primarily as history will therefore be better served by books with a different emphasis.

* [*Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0415110351) by R. W. Sharples is a short, easy to read account of Stoicism and its primary rivals, Epicureanism and Skepticism. The three philosophies have much in common, and describing them jointly, pointing out their similarities and differences, is a useful approach in understanding any of them individually. 
* [*The Stoics*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0872202534) by F. H. Sandbach is short, but very dense. It provides significantly deeper discussion of Stoic physics and cosmology than the other sources listed here, and spends more time discussing the subtleties in translating the various Greek technical terms than most.
* [*Stoicism*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0520249089) by John Sellars is another good general introduction to Stoicism that includes more emphasis on logic and physics than many others.
* [*The Stoics: A Guide for the Perplexed*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1847060447) by M. Andrew Holowchak is an easy, systematic overview of historical Stoicism.

## Other useful classical sources

In addition to the classical sources listed as "starting points," there are a number of additional classical sources that can provide a significantly deeper and more systematic understanding, and provide material for further study.

Unfortunately, the original canon of books written by Chrysippus, Zeno of Citium, and other leaders of the school are lost. A number of fragments and second-hand accounts remain, and there are two collections that make these accounts available:

 * Long and Sedley's [*The Hellenistic Philosophers*](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2959440W/The_Hellenistic_philosophers)
 * Inwood and Gerson's [*The Stoics Reader*](http://www.hackettpublishing.com/philosophy/the-stoics-reader)

In addition to the *Enchiridion*, Arrian took more extensive notes on Epictetus's lectures. Many of these survive, and several translations are public domain and available free online, including those by [Oldfather](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Epictetus,_the_Discourses_as_reported_by_Arrian,_the_Manual,_and_Fragments), [Carter](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html) and [Matheson](https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/content/books/ebooks/discourses-of-epictetus.pdf).

Notes on some lectures of Musonius Rufus, Epictetus's teacher, are also available in print and [on-line](https://sites.google.com/site/thestoiclife/the_teachers/musonius-rufus).

Seneca the Younger wrote a number of essays not listed in the "starting points" section, and most collections of his letters are not comprehensive. Tracking down these remaining letters and essays is recommended. Notable examples include [*On Benefits*](http://www.stoics.com/seneca_essays_book_3.html), [*On Anger*](http://www.stoics.com/seneca_essays_book_1.html#ANGER1), [*On Firmness*](http://www.stoics.com/seneca_essays_book_1.html#FIRMNESS1), [*On Mercy*](http://www.stoics.com/seneca_essays_book_1.html#MERCY1), and [*On Providence*](http://www.stoics.com/seneca_essays_book_1.html#PROVIDENCE1).

Cicero left a considerable body of work, and *On Duties* is not the only one of relevance to those studying Stoicism. Other recommended works by Cicero include the [*Tusculan Disputations*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988), [*Stoic Paradoxes*](https://archive.org/details/cicerosthreebook00ciceiala), [*On Ends*](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Finibus/home.html), [*On Fate*](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/cicero/de_fato_english.html), and [*On the Nature of the Gods*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum). 

[Diogenes Laërtius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_La%C3%ABrtius)'s *Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers*, an encyclopedia of the views of different philosophers written sometime between 200 CE and 500 CE, includes an account of Stoicism in the [entry on Zeno of Citium](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D1). The entry can be challenging to read, and Diogenes Laërtius has been criticized for not completely understanding the views he is reporting, but this second hand account is valuable in that it is an attempt to give a balanced overview of the views of the school, rather than the opinions of one specific author on the topics that interest that author.

[Arius Didymus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arius_Didymus)'s [*Epitome of Stoic Ethics*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1589836294) is a summary of Stoic ethics, preserved in [Stobaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stobaeus)'s *Anthology*. Inwood and Gerson's [*The Stoics Reader*](http://www.hackettpublishing.com/philosophy/the-stoics-reader) contains the *Epitome* in its entirety (Text 102, pp. 124-151).

## Descriptions of Stoic exercises

Good resources for exercises a modern person inspired by Stoicism might want to practice include:

 * [24 Stoic Spiritual Exercises](https://stoicfellowship.com/assets/pdfs/24%20Stoic%20Spiritual%20Exercises.pdf), quotes from Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius with commentary by Massimo Pigliucci and Greg Lopez, free online.
 * [Practical Stoicism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/4bz797/practical_stoicism/), a free ebook by /u/GreyFreeman
 * Donald Robertson's [*Stoicism and the Art of Happiness*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1444187104) or [*How to Think Like a Roman Emperor*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1250196620)
 * Massimo Pigliucci's [*A Handbook for New Stoics*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1615195335)
 * Elen Buzare's [*Stoic Spiritual Exercises*](http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/elen-buzar%C3%A9/stoic-spiritual-exercises/paperback/product-18840210.html)
 * The final chapter of M. Andrew Holowchak's [*The Stoics: A Guide for the Perplexed*](http://openlibrary.org/works/OL6215232W/The_stoics)

## Predecessors and Successors

The Stoic were strongly influenced by a number of their predecessors and rivals, and in turn exerted a significant influence on many philosophies that followed them. Some works with the strongest relationship to Stoicism include:

 * [Xenophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon)'s [*Apology*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apology_%28Xenophon%29), [*Memorabilia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorabilia_%28Xenophon%29), and [*Symposium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_%28Xenophon%29), which give Xenophon's account of Socrates. Zeno is said to have been inspired to study philosophy after reading part of the *Memorabilia* at a book sellers.
 * Early dialogues of [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), particularly the [*Apology*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apology_%28Plato%29), [*Crito*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crito), [*Euthyphro*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro), [*Gorgias*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgias_%28dialogue%29), and [*Euthydemus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthydemus_%28dialogue%29). Zeno studied with the Platonist [Polemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemon_%28scholarch%29), and adopted some elements while rejecting others. (Which views expressed by the character "Socrates" in the dialogues actually represent the views of the historical person is [a matter of considerable debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_problem).)
 * [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)'s [*Nicomachean Ethics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics) describes the ethics of the [Peripatetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripatetic_school), which has strong similarities to Stoicism, but also significant differences. [This essay](https://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/stoa/twoethix.htm) by Jan Garrett describes some of the similarities and differences.
 * [Quintus Sextius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Sextius)'s [*Sentences of Sextus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentences_of_Sextus), a short collection of aphorisms by a Roman philosopher who mixed Stoicism with Pythagoreanism.
 * [Simplicius of Cilicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicius_of_Cilicia)'s [*Commontary on the Enchiridion of Epictetus*](https://archive.org/details/epictetushismora00epic/page/n4) is a [Neoplatonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism) commentary on Epictetus's *Enchiridion*.
 * [Boethius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boethius)'s [*The Consolation of Philosophy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Consolation_of_Philosophy) is a book of philosophy written by a Neoplatonist awaiting execution. While nominally Neoplatonist, it contains little that could not have been said by a Stoic.
 * [Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, Lord of Montaigne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne)'s [*Essays*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/1230).
 * [Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Ashley-Cooper,_3rd_Earl_of_Shaftesbury)'s [*Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0521578922) (a collection of essays) and [*Philosophical Regimen*](https://archive.org/details/thelifeunpublish00shafuoft/page/n8) (his posthumously edited and published personal philosophical journal). *Characteristics* shows a strong Stoic influence, but does not refer to it directly, while the *Regimen* repeatedly references and quotes Stoic works, and explicitly applies Stoic concepts. Many modern readers find his early 18th century English dialect difficult. The "Early Modern Texts" website has prepared [editions of several of his essays](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/shaftesbury) from *Characteristics* with modernized English.
 * [Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl)'s [*Man's Search for Meaning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-8070-1427-1)
 * Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT) were both strongly influenced by Stoicism; see Donald Robertson's [*The Philosophy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=036721914X).
 * [Lawrence Becker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_C._Becker)'s [*A New Stoicism*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=069117721X) is a speculative attempt to describe what Stoic philosophy might have looked like today had the school survived.

## Advanced and scholarly works

In addition to the sources listed in other sections, there are a number of contemporary scholarly works that are highly valuable in understanding and interpreting Stoic philosophy. Some particularly recommended books are:

 * [Julia Annas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Annas)'s [*The Morality of Happiness*](https://doi.org/10.1093/0195096525.001.0001)

There are also several highly recommended collections of scholarly papers by multiple authors:

 * [*Problems in Stoicism*](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=048512128X) edited by [A. A. Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._A._Long)

## Older introductory overviews

In additions to the recent books on Stoicism listed above, there are several worthwhile late-19th and early 20th century books that describe Stoicism. Free scans of many of these can be found on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/texts), and facsimile reprint editions (of varying quality, sometimes very poor) are available as well. In some cases, there are ebooks for sale that are just uncorrected (and nearly unreadable) [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) output.  Both of the books below are good introductions to Stoicism, and available in modern editions of reasonable quality. (There are *also* poor quality editions of both available, and some major online booksellers make it very easy to accidentally get a different edition than you intend.)

 * E. Vernon Arnold's [*Roman Stoicism*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64488) (1911) is long but clearly written, a comprehensive overview neatly divided into short sections. (The [Routledge Revivals edition](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1138016063) is good, but some of those from facsimile publishers are of very poor quality.)
 * [R. D. Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Drew_Hicks)'s [*Stoic and Epicurean*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.152128/page/n10) (1910) gives a more compact, less comprehensive overview. ([The Dover edition](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0486832600) is of reasonably good quality.)

## Translations of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations*

The translation by [Gregory Hays](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0812968255) is the most popular here, but there are sometimes questions about its accuracy. Other widely recommended translations include those of  the [Robin Hard](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=1853264865), [Hammond](http://www.worldcat.org/title/meditations/oclc/63185834), and [Hicks and Hicks](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL7981938W/The_emperor%27s_handbook).  The one by  [Farquharson](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ABookSources&isbn=0679412719)  is worth looking into as well; although the translation itself is in modern English it is not the most eloquent or easiest to read, but the extensive notes are very valuable for understanding references, finding related entries, and otherwise providing context, and it is available [free online](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Meditations_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Antoninus).  There are many other translations old enough to be public domain (at least in the U.S.), but most of them mimic archaic (King James Bible style) English, which isn't to everyone's taste. There are a few people who do like the (free) [translation by Long](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html). 

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/6301sc/best_meditations_translation/dfqdzyj/) shows the same passage as translated in many of the different translations.

The last 5 pages of Haines' introduction to his 1916 translation (starting [page xvi](https://archive.org/stream/thecommuningswit00marcuoft#page/n23/mode/2up))  discusses the merits and flaws of a number of earlier translations
